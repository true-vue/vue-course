# Vue SPA Dev enviroment preparation:
1. Install Visual Studio Code editor https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install node.js for running javascript outside browser https://nodejs.org/en (npm included)
3. [Option] install nvm for managing node.js version between projects
4. Vue (browser) dev tools https://devtools.vuejs.org/getting-started/installation -> https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?utm_source=ext_sidebar

# Visual Studio Code setup for vue.js
1. Install "Vue official" extension.
2. Install "ESLint" extension.
3. Format on save (file > preferences > settings)
4. Default formatter

# General instructions can be found at:
https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start#creating-a-vue-application
and https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling

# Creating new Vue SPA project (javascript with options api)
1. Open terminal and create new vue project with with command: npm create vue@latest.
2. [optional] confirm requirement for installing create-vue@{version} (y)
- Project name: <enter project name>
- Add TypeScript? » No 
- Add JSX Support? » No 
- Add Vue Router for Single Page Application development? » No
- Add Pinia for state management? » No 
- Add Vitest for Unit Testing? » No 
- Add an End-to-End Testing Solution? » No
- Add ESLint for code quality? » Yes
- Add Prettier for code formatting? » Yes

3. Once project created follow console instruction (terminal/cmd):

Done. Now run:

  > cd vue-project
  > npm install

  npm install => this command will install all dependences (node_modules folder will be created)

3. For running the project use (terminal/cmd):
  > npm run dev

4. You can open project folder in VS code editor now running:
  > code .
  
  Or open VS code manually and open project from file menu.


# Project structure (project folders and files):
* `.vscode` -> VS code editor local (project) settings
* `node_module` -> project references (libs / packages). Usually this project will be ignored by git / version control system.
* `public` -> static resorces that are directly copied to build output.
* `src` - src folder is primary working directory for app development
* `src/assets` - resources that are part of build process (for example: css and scss files)
* `src/components` - typical for small scale project folder where application components are located.
* `src/App.vue` -> root component of the application - here any other compontents are embeded in tree like manner.
* `src/main.js` -> entry point, here app instance is created and mounted to html document object model.
* `index.html` -> html file template (this file will be loaded on first request to our application)

# Other files:
* `.gitignore` - defines ignore patterns for git (some files or dirs will not be part of source control)
* `.prettierrs.json` - fine tuning for Prettier settings. Prettier takes care how our code looks like (basically code formating, including spacing)
* `.eslist.config.json` - fine tuning for ESLint settings. Eslist enhances our code quality giving as code related errors and warning including suggestions for resolving some issues.
* `*** package.json ***` - primary file for node project settings, especially project references.
* `vite.config.js` - vite server settings. Vite is super fast dev server with build-in build chain.
